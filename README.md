# Hermite-Normal-Form
An algorithm to compute the Hermite Normal row form of a non-singular n dimensional matrix with integer entries.
The Hermite Normal form is analagous to the Echelon form over the real numbers but is restricted to integral operations.
We compute the row form of the HNF which produces a lower triangular matrix with positive determinant whose largest entries are on the main diagonal.
